static : Default position , no special qualities.

Relative : shift it around the page relative to it's own original position

Fixed: give position fixed relative to the viewport ( what we see in the browser) for example navbar left : 0px , top 0px

Absolute : absolute relative to it's closest parent 

Sticky : mix of  fixed w static


to make a child element relative or absolute u gotta make sure that the parent isn't positioned
static.


1.3 em = multiplies parent size by 1.3 




.images{
    text-align: center;
    margin: 80px 0;
    white-space: nowrap;
}
.images li{
    display: inline-block;
    text-decoration: none;
    width: 40%;
    margin: 20px 5%;
}

usually when we give 40% or 25% to anything like that , they dont align next to each other but one under the other 
theyy jump line so we gotta do white-space : nowrap 


Btw guys , Media Queries Tell the browser how to style an element at particular viewport 
dimensions
View port meta tag : Tells the browser what width the viewport should banner
Responsive images : Only load smaller iamges for mobile devices

Should always do mobile first approach
